<br />
A group of stalkers, for the first time, reaches the very heart of the Zone-the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant-and triggers a cataclysm on the brink of a catastrophe. An immense blast of anomalous energy transforms the Zone: the once reliable and relatively safe roads are no longer so, the landscape is wiped clean by outbursts of anomalies, and previously unknown areas appear on the Zone map. Stalkers and expeditions perish or end up isolated within the lost territories.<br />
<br />
With the anomalous activity at its maximum, the unstable Zone continues to tremor with outbursts. The transformation of the Zone map destabilizes the fragile balance of forces in the Zone. Hostilities for the new territories, artifact fields and spheres of influence flare up among groups. There are no more old enemies or friends - now, everyone watches out only for themselves. The Factions War has begun.<br />
<br />
The protagonist is a mercenary who appeared at the edge of the opposition between stalker factions, Strelok and even the Zone itself. The main character experiences the key role in the events that led to the creation of the Zone right up to the point from which the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game begins.<br />
<br />
What new challenges await stalkers within the depths of the new zone? Why do anomalous outbursts continue to rattle the Zone, and what can be done to stop them? Which faction will take the upper hand in the Factions War? These and many other questions will be answered in the official prequel - S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky.","₩ 10,500","['Single-player', 'Multi-player', 'PvP', 'Online PvP', 'LAN PvP', 'Steam Cloud']",Action,7680.0

Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork.<br><br><i>Skirmish</i> --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match.<br><br><i>Occupy</i> --- There is one central territorial objective in the area.

Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy's intel, or when an enemy stealing your team's intel is neutralized.

Set in a universe somewhere between Lord of the Rings and Spinal Tap, it’s a fresh take on the action/driving genre, which in this case is full of imitation cover bands, demons intent on enslaving humanity and Heavy metal tunes.

It’s lighter-flicking awesomeness that will melt your face clean off.<br><br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Brütal Legend’s combat is a combination of classic action slasher and real time strategy mechanics.  Melee and ranged combat come from your double-sided broadaxe and demon-slaying, pyrotechnic-creating guitar.  Add that 1-2 punch to a guitar solo mechanic that can summon objects, buff your teammates, or cripple your opponents, and you have a deep, gratifying core gameplay combat loop that is fun for the hardcore and accessible for the casual.  On top of that, players will journey from Roadie to Rock God by commanding legions of metalheads into Brütal Victory and sending troops charging into battle.<br><br><br><strong>A Streaming Open World</strong><br>Brütal Legend gives you the freedom to walk, drive, or fly anywhere in a fully streaming open world whose art style is inspired by some of the most iconic and hilariously rad metal album covers ever created.

It has a MASSIVE metal soundtrack from every era of metal music: 1970’s classic metal to 1980’s hair metal to the scarier cousins of 1990’s metal. And of course, Jack Black pays the ultimate homage to metal as Eddie the Roadie, continuing the theme from the work of his band, Tenacious D and his previous films like School of Rock and High Fidelity.<br><br><br><strong>Multiplayer Mayhem</strong><br>4v4 &quot;skirmish&quot; multiplayer marries action combat with a strategic unit-control mechanic. As the leader of one of the factions in the game, the player will direct his armies in a Battle of the Bands where the trophy is survival.

The townspeople of Banished are your primary resource. They are born, grow older, work, have children of their own, and eventually die. Keeping them healthy, happy, and well-fed are essential to making your town grow. Building new homes is not enough—there must be enough people to move in and have families of their own.<br />
<br />
Banished has no skill trees. Any structure can be built at any time, provided that your people have collected the resources to do so. There is no money. Instead, your hard-earned resources can be bartered away with the arrival of trade vessels. These merchants are the key to adding livestock and annual crops to the townspeople’s diet; however, their lengthy trade route comes with the risk of bringing illnesses from abroad.<br />
<br />
There are twenty different occupations that the people in the city can perform from farming, hunting, and blacksmithing, to mining, teaching, and healing. No single strategy will succeed for every town. Some resources may be more scarce from one map to the next. The player can choose to replant forests, mine for iron, and quarry for rock, but all these choices require setting aside space into which you cannot expand.<br />

DO NOT BUTTON MASH!</strong><br><br>One of the biggest challenges we had while making the game is stopping the player from button mashing. When our friends play tested our game they’d instinctively button mash, they couldn’t help themselves. It must have been the many years of playing other brawlers that engraved it in their minds the notion of rapidly pressing buttons to kill your foes. The game’s designed in such a way that if you button mash, you die. Every press matters. Although playing the game should still be simple, you see a bad guy in front of you, you attack him, he dies. If you punch even once when there’s no enemy in front of you, you’re going to miss. If you miss, chances are you’re going to get hit. It’s a simple system but it’s ruthless to button mashers. We spent much time setting up visual and audio queues as well as many warnings trying to steer players away from their natural button mashing tendencies.","₩ 5,000","['Single-player', 'Steam Achievements', 'Partial Controller Support', 'Steam Leaderboards']",Action,11901.0

485,BeamNG.drive,"BeamNG.<i>drive</i> is a realistic, immersive driving game offering near-limitless possibilities.

With years of meticulous design, research, and experience, we authentically recreate the feeling and excitement of real world driving.<br><br>We are a small team from around the world with no obligations to publishers or outside interests. Our users and modding community are our first priority. Help us make BeamNG.<i>drive</i> the ultimate driving experience and discover what an open and uncompromising soft-body vehicle simulator can be.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Why is BeamNG.<i>drive</i> the game for you?</h2><br>As an open world vehicle simulator, BeamNG.<i>drive</i> will cover a large array of vehicular disciplines - everything from a delivery mission in a box truck to a high speed rally race or a destruction derby. The vehicle customization and detail will allow you to make your car or truck all your own - fix it up, upgrade it, or strip away body panels to reduce weight. There are a lot of different types of gameplay we want to implement beyond just racing and crashing, such as police chases, stunt challenges, and other specialized minigames. Eventually we would like to have some kind of single player open world career mode, with persistent vehicle ownership and procedurally generated used vehicles to buy and events to run them in.<br><br>In some ways, BeamNG.<i>drive</i> is about doing anything you want with a car or truck - the stuff other games <i>don't</i> let you do. You can go off-roading in a family sedan or hurl a delivery truck around a racing circuit, all with beautiful soft-body simulation physics. You can mod those same vehicles to be racing beasts, derby monsters, or off-road behemoths - or just thrash them stock. At the end of the day, BeamNG.<i>drive</i> gives you the gameplay <i>you</i> want, and doesn't force you to do anything that you don't think is fun or interesting.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">The future of the game and our physics engine</h2><br>As we optimize our game and computer technology improves, the amount of vehicles which can be simultaneously simulated at a smooth framerate will increase. Right now you can run 4 to 6 cars at one time on a high end quad-core processor. Each vehicle has around 400 nodes and 4000 beams, all being simulated 2000 times per second. We hope to expand the number of simultaneous vehicles possible to at least 8 with a mid-range processor.<br><br>We will also look towards having multiplayer in the future, but it may be some time before we can create the multiplayer experience everyone is expecting. We are well aware of the demand for multiplayer and we want it just as much as you, but for the short term we are focusing on the single player career mode, various driving events, fixing bugs, and creating more content. It is feasible that we could implement local and/or same PC multiplayer in the interim.<br><br>Also, the possibilities extend beyond land vehicles. Users in our community have already made planes and helicopters that fly purely with the existing vehicle aerodynamic physics, with no cheating whatsoever. BeamNG can simulate aircraft in a very authentic way due to its soft-body physics. All the flex that happens to a real plane's airframe arises naturally in BeamNG, and the consequences of excessive stress are also modeled. Fly too fast and your wings will start to bend and rip off.

This mode is only for the pros -- all of the bots move like lightning -- dodging, jumping and inflicting A LOT more damage with their standard attacks than do their Novice counterparts. <br>					</li><li><strong>Enhanced Bot AI</strong> - Bots in Unreal Tournament play as if they're jacked up on a big old shot of steroids. Their basic deathmatching skills have been virtually perfected, their understanding of the game rules is professorial, their ability to navigate levels is GPS-like, and their threat to your existence is very real. <br>					</li><li><strong>Radio Chatter</strong> - Each of the commands at your disposal in the game is accompanied by both a text message on screen AND an audio message. Pleas for back-up or for cover fire are accompanied by pre-recorded sequences communicating your needs. Making this especially cool is the fact that you can hear your opponents' messages too (even if you're playing against bots 'cause bots are people, too). <br>					</li><li><strong>New Command Line Options</strong> - For the hardcore server masters, this is the dream way to access features and manage a game. Virtually any option you want to tweak can be accessed via the UT command line. Nice and easy! <br>					</li><li><strong>Improved User Interface</strong> - Unreal Tournament introduced a better way to see what is happening during a game. By using a unique heads up display (HUD) for each game type (Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Domination, and Assault), the game provides ALL the info needed to play effectively WITHOUT bombarding the player with excessive info. <br>					</li><li><strong>UBrowser</strong> - Unreal Tournament's robust Ubrowser system provides the easiest way to find a game on the Internet and jump into battle. The Ubrowser eliminates the need to download third-party server querying applications. It's as simple as one-two-frag. By clicking on the &quot;Play Online&quot; button and then selecting a server from the list, the game is on. <br>					</li><li><strong>Spectator Cams</strong> - Watching a game of Unreal Tournament has the potential to be almost as much fun as playing it. Thanks to the Spectator Cams, gamers can enter a game and hop around to designated Spectator Cams to view the action on the level. Even cooler, the camera can be &quot;attached&quot; to one of the players in the level to view the action from their perspective. Either way, it's a cool feature and a great way to learn for people new to the world of online gaming. <br>					</li><li><strong>Jump Mode</strong> - Jump twice as high as normal. It's sorta' like having a never-ending pair of jumpboots on. The impact these boots have on gameplay is almost indescribable. It changes the dynamic completely.</li></ul>© 2000, Epic Games, Inc.

In this post-apocalyptic urban world, death is waiting around every corner, at the top of high-rise buildings, and in the grasp of powerful teleporting creatures known as 'Nethers'. These creatures and the other players are real challenges to overcome, requiring tactical gameplay, awareness, stealth, and cooperation. To navigate this high-tension environment, you must use skill and cunning in order to scavenge, trade, craft or loot for food, weapons, supplies, and other resources necessary to stay alive in a desolate and dangerous city. Team up with other survivors and take advantage of group play, as a tribe, to complete treacherous world objectives, or play as a lone wolf in an attempt to endure the hostile environment. In the end you must decide whether to Prey or Pray.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Key Features</h2><br><strong>EXPLORE</strong><br>The game's landscape is a beautifully conceived vision of a post apocalyptic Chicago, ravaged by disaster and time. Almost every low and high-rise building can be individually explored in a cityscape that stretches 150 blocks. Beyond the city lies the Wastelands, an unforgiving desolate landscape that is slowly sinking into the earth. <br><br><strong>SURVIVE, CRAFT, TRADE, LOOT AND SHOOT</strong><br>Start off, armed only with a kitchen knife and scavenge your way through an environment on a daily battle to stay alive. Beware the Nether, poor mutated souls who roam the city in search of human flesh. Scavenge for food and water to stay nourished, and search for useful items that could be crafted into makeshift weapons to help in your battle for life.  Hunt and kill Nether to trade their body parts to the mysterious Cult located in the few markets that scatter the city. Over time, build up your skills and earn rewards for surviving each precious new day. But always beware of the other survivors who may be only one moment away from death, and see killing you and looting your possessions as their only salvation. <br><br><strong>TRIBES AND TERRITORY WARS </strong><br>Find safety in numbers by joining a tribe. Only tribes can capture and own territory, and the urban landscape is the perfect setting for turf domination. Compete with rival tribes in territory wars for control of the city by capturing strategic landmarks to reap resources and experience; prove your dominance over all other tribes. Spy on rival tribes or infiltrate and kill them by playing as a Nether. Ambush them from above by swooping in for the kill using the wing suit. Tribes change the survival experience by establishing a true social construct, with all the consequences of behavior that you would expect in the real world. Your actions have real repercussions enforced organically through reputation and standing.<br><br><strong>PLAYER AND GROUP MISSIONS</strong><br>Players can complete an assortment of individual or group missions to earn money, experience and reputation. Perform vital supply runs between the markets, work with your tribe to take down the swarms of Nether lead by the vicious boss Reaper that sporadically surge to attack neighborhoods, or keep the creatures out of the Safezones by working in groups to repair the anti-nether devices when they fail.<br><br><strong>CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION </strong><br>Nether offers a wide variety of character customization and allows you to play as a male or female character.

Most perks are designed to change the way you have to play or the weapons you'll want to use. Do you want more speed in exchange for less health, or maybe is better to have mana regeneration? Increase drop rate, or refill ammo here and now? No number game here, simple and direct choices.<br />
<br />
We've also ensured that, as a proper FPS game, the experience is quick and direct. There's no inventory to manage or the need to compare two almost equal item drops, just weapon selection, and mana/health are usually the bargaining chip.<br />
<br />
A whole arsenal of magic and alchemic weapons will be at your disposal. Wreak havoc among your enemies, but watch your mana reserves or you might regret it later!<br />

<br />
As you sail about you will find resources you can make use of, upgrades for your ship, new towns that will ask your assistance, and as you get farther out from the starting area -- various pirates that will attempt to take what's rightfully yours. Combat experience will let you unlock new talents and abilities to make that particular line of work easier. <br />

As you take up consignments with towns and fulfill their production shortages, the towns will grow, offering more quests, more resources and better items. As the towns continue to grow they will offer you a choice to upgrade your ship itself. Would you prefer a fast Schooner to explore the world, or a heavy Galleon that's able to take up 5 consignments at once? Or perhaps a massive Ship of the Line to take the fight with the pirates to their heartlands? <br />

Resource locations strategically spread throughout the game will create inequity and envy.  Players will have the ability to make war, or even capture and hold other players in order to get what they want.  Each player will have the power to decide the fate of the kingdom, or choose to entirely forego the responsibility of ruling the kingdom and roam the land as a freeman.<br><br><br><strong>CAPTURE</strong><br><br>Players have the ability to capture, hold, and execute other players. The player can capture them with rope or iron shackles. Once shackled, a player is no longer able to access their inventory aside from their orifice slot. The captured player's inventory is accessible for the captor to search them.<br> <br>Additionally, a rope will be attached to a prisoner which will allow them to be pulled in any direction their captor wishes. In order to avoid severe grieving situations, players can hide a sharp stone or lock pick in their orifice. This &quot;hidden&quot; item can help them escape capture or commit suicide.<br><br><strong>PUNISHMENT &amp; DEATH</strong><br><br>Punishment &amp; Death Once the player has control of a captive, there are several options available for managing a prisoner.  Options range from simply locking them in a cage or dungeon, public humiliation in the pillory, or simply executing them.<br><br><strong>THE ANCIENT THRONE</strong><br><br>The Ancient Throne can be claimed by any player. Holding the Ancient Throne will grant its owner dominion over the entire map (change name of realm) and taxation rights over every other player.  The King of the Ancient Throne will receive the ability to collect the resource tax from every player within the game by visiting the Ravens Treasure Tree. The ravens automatically collect taxes in the game (behind the scenes of course, sneaky little things), and place them in the chests in their Treasure Tree. <br> <br>In addition, the King of the Ancient Throne will have access to the Ancient Sword and the Ancient Crown. <br><br><strong>PRODUCTION &amp; REFINING STATIONS</strong><br><br>Players will have the ability to collect resources and to craft them into useful items or building materials. Additionally, the progression mechanic for being able to craft higher valued items will be reliant on upgrading production stations to a higher level.  (Need a better quality sword?  Upgrade your anvil.)  Production and refining stations can craft or refine items as long as there are resources available unless ordered to do otherwise.  This allows the player the freedom to do other things while his kingdom remains productive. <br><br><strong>COLLECTION STATIONS</strong><br><br>Collection stations can be placed for grain and water. Collection stations will passively produce raw materials given they have enough fuel.<br><br>These collection stations will be fully interactive and if left un-defended will offer a nice target for unscrupulous or enemy players.

Players will now need to employ one of many different techniques for entry.<br><br>The ranged option is to build trebuchets and launch large stones from afar at your opponent's castle. Players must place a counterweight to offset their projectile weight in order to get the range and destruction power they need from the stone they are launching. Players may also rotate the trebuchet. This alignment takes some practice but is very rewarding when set correctly.<br><br>Players may choose to go a more stealthy route by crafting lock picks. Lock picks, however, are very hard to craft, and do not work on iron doors and iron gates.<br><br>Players defending a base may employ their own trebuchet or set up a ballista which is great for killing other players at range.<br><br><strong>FIRST PERSON COMBAT</strong><br> <br>Our combat systems allow melee and ranged combat to take center stage when war breaks out.

Players fight over the scarce resources and face off to defend or capture the throne.<br><br><strong>MELEE</strong><br> <br>Players equip brutal weapons and use mouse buttons in an attempt to chop, slice, &amp; stab through an opponent. Players will want to upgrade their weaponry to inflict the highest amount of damage as melee combat will always be dangerous and unpredictable.  Armor will be highly prized in Melee as it will keep you in a fight much longer.<br> <br>We support delimbing and decapitation of an opponent to represent the visceral and brutal experience of medieval close-quarters warfare.  A variety of period realistic weapons and armor will be available for the player to craft as they progress toward elder content.<br><br><strong>RANGED</strong><br><br>Ranged fighting in ROK will encompass the use of the bow, crossbow, javelin, and throwing stones. A good way for a player to stay alive in a fight during the early game will be to use ranged weaponry and speed.  Keeping out of sword range from a marauding knight is always a good idea, but even more so if you’re not equipped with the quality of armor that can absorb a hit or two.<br> <br>A simple bow and spear may be capable of taking down wild game, but may not provide enough piercing power to get through the finest plate male.

1463,X4: Foundations,"X4: Foundations is the latest title in the popular X series of <strong>space simulation / sandbox games</strong>, played as action games from a first-person perspective in a living breathing universe, with <strong>TRADE FIGHT BUILD THINK</strong> as the common tag-line. X4: Foundations is unique in its depth, <strong>simulating an entire universe of NPC ships and stations, forming a realistic economy</strong>. It consists of a huge universe, simulated from the bottom up. Hundreds of stations, and thousands of ships, trade goods among themselves. Prices change based on supply and demand; resources are mined and processed in several stages. This economy is linked directly to the simulation of major conflicts in a universe with dynamically-acting factions. Every player decision can dramatically change the future of the game universe. <strong>Step in and live your very own space adventure!</strong><br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/392160/extras/3.0_Text_no_pilot_no_shadow.png?t=1604662395"" /><br>X4: Foundations has been significantly enlarged with its <strong>3.0 Update</strong> – this is the perfect time for space game enthusiasts to newly discover or revisit the biggest space sandbox this side of the galaxy!

Become the best pilot out there with our <strong>new flight school</strong>.<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/392160/extras/gif_fight.gif?t=1604662395"" /><br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>Start your journey</strong><br>In X4, you can start your journey from <strong>a number of different gamestarts</strong> and as a number of different characters, each with their own role, set of relationships and different ships and technologies to start with. No matter how you start, you are always <strong>free to develop in any other direction</strong>. Focus on exploration, make money with illegal trading and theft, command large battle fleets or become the greatest entrepreneur ever. It's all up to <strong>you</strong> to decide.<br><br></li><li><strong>Fly every ship</strong><br>X4 allows you to <strong>fly all ships personally</strong>. From small scouts over a wide range of ship classes up to the biggest carrier, everything can be piloted from the cockpit or an external view. A big focus in the development of X4 has been to achieve a <strong>seamless and immersive experience when moving between ships</strong>. You can leave a ship, climb down a ladder, walk over the dock of a large space station into another ship you may have parked there and replace the pilot that was working for you just by clicking on his chair.<br><br></li><li><strong>Build space stations and upgrade your ships</strong><br>Building space stations and factories has always been a foundation of the X games. After gaining enough money through fighting or trading, most players want to <strong>establish their own economy</strong> and <strong>start influencing the universe on a larger scale</strong>. In X4, it is now possible to be completely <strong>free and creative</strong>. Stations can be constructed from a variety of modules, be it production modules, living sections, docks or many other types of parts. The <strong>powerful new map system</strong> allows you to drag and connect modules using a connection system to design your own unique creations. Ships also offer a variety of upgrades. Engines, weapons and other equipment can be added in a graphical editor and actually seen on the ship.<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/392160/extras/gif_docking.gif?t=1604662395"" /><br><br></li><li><strong>Experience the most dynamic X universe ever</strong> <br>X4 is the first X game to allow our races and factions to <strong>freely build and expand their empires</strong>; the same flexibility the player enjoys in creatively designing space stations from modular building blocks is also available to them. Races expand their empire based on supply and demand, which leads to an extremely dynamic universe where every action the player makes can <strong>influence the course of the entire universe</strong>.<br><br></li><li><strong>Manage your empire with a powerful map</strong><br>Once you have more ships and many NPCs working for you as pilots, crew or station managers, the map will be your preferred method of managing it all. Ships can be ordered with simple clicks and through drag-and-drop operations to set their future path and commands. Graphically plan your trade routes, coordinate attacks with your entire fleet, manage the hierarchy or send ships on remote exploration missions.<br><br></li><li><strong>Dive into the most detailed X economy ever</strong><br>One of the key selling points of X games has always been the<strong> realistic, simulated economy</strong>. Wares produced by hundreds of stations and transported by thousands of ships are actually traded by NPCs and prices develop based on this simulated economy. This is the foundation of our living and breathing universe. Now with X4, we have taken another, massive step. For the first time in any X game,<strong> all parts of the NPC economy are manufactured from resources</strong>. Ships, weapons, upgrades, ammo and even stations. You name it. Everything comes out of the simulated economy.<br><br></li><li><strong>Research and teleport</strong><br>The seamless change from ship to ship and from NPCs controlling your empire for you continues on a higher level. Once you own a larger fleet, you will be very interested in researching a technology from your HQ: <strong>Teleportation</strong>. Once you've unlocked teleportation, you can jump from ship to ship a lot quicker and experience all the critical situations your NPCs encounter first hand. Every order you have given to a ship before turns into a mission objective when you pilot the ship yourself. The moment you leave again, your pilot takes the helm and continues with their previous orders.</li></ul>","₩ 59,000","['Single-player', 'Steam Achievements', 'Full controller support', 'Steam Trading Cards', 'Steam Workshop', 'Steam Cloud']",Action,7893.0

1703,Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator,"The Game:<br />
<br />
Here is a sandbox like no other. Create massive battles with absolutely no limits. Want to see 10,000 chickens fight an army of Romans?? Sure, why not. Want to see a company of WW2 U.S soldiers fight 11,000 Medieval soldiers?? There are simply no limits to the carnage you can achieve in Epic Battle Simulator. Mess around with a massive variety of units. Everything from, Roman Centurions, Medieval soldiers, Knights, Orcs, Trolls, and yes, chickens! The main focus in this game is giving the player no restrictions to what he can do. That is why we decided not to limit the amount of units in battle. Want to see what a battle of 100,000 units looks like? We don't recommend going past 10,000 for most machines but its your CPU, do what you want! On top of that, you can play as any one of the units in the game, getting up close and personal to help change the tides of a massive battle, while rallying teammates and giving them orders!<br />
<br />
The Technology:<br />
<br />
Unfortunately there really aren't many engines that you can chuck 10,000 characters in and expect good performance. This is why I worked months on end to create the most powerful crowd rendering system ever conceived in Unity engine. The detail of each character has little effect on performance while each individual acts independently, but is working towards a greater good for his team.  Each individual decides his own path and navigates complex environments. But I didn't stop there! With the large open environments, I needed a more dynamic lighting solution than the one built in to Unity engine. So I built my own dynamic global illumination lighting engine. This enables bounce light completely in real time. What does that mean? That means every piece of shiny armor is reflecting it's true surroundings, every bright surfaces illuminates it's surroundings and effects the overall lighting. <br />

Overlord famously commenced with the D-Day landings in Normandy and ended in the Liberation of Paris, while Bagration - a far less well-known but far larger Russian operation - crushed the invading German forces in the east, leading to their complete withdrawal from Soviet territory.  Had either operation been unsuccessful, history could have been very different. <br>				In the ultimate test of military strategy, Order of War will challenge you not only to lead America's finest to victory in the west, but also place you in command of the German forces charged with repelling the Red Army's seemingly unstoppable offensive in the east. Even the keenest military minds will find that it's one thing to make history, but quite another to change it.  <br><br>			...Do you have what it takes to command? <br><br>			Key features: <br><br>				<ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Experience WWII warfare on an epic, cinematic stage; that truly captures the intensity and scale of the battlefield. <br>				</li><li>Take Command of an entire armoured force consisting of up to 1000 soldiers, tank divisions, armoured vehicles, heavy artillery and air force. <br>				</li><li>Players can choose between two different campaign modes offering completely different storyline, missions, objectives and environments. <br>				</li><li>Experience the unique dynamic camera that allows players to command troops over huge geographical scale whilst maintaining movie-like vistas and detail. <br>				</li></ul>","₩ 8,500",['Single-player'],Strategy,282.0

Missions range from capturing crashed UFOs or alien bases to defending cities (or even Xenonaut facilities) against alien attack. You'll experience the chill of encountering a new alien for the first time and the joys of test-firing a new weapon for the first time.

Your priorities must be balanced carefully if you are to win the war.</li></ul><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> Research Tree: Xenonauts has an extensive research tree with almost a hundred projects to unlock, each with its own unique description and painted artwork. It slowly reveals the intentions and origins of the invaders, while also unlocking new battlefield equipment, aircraft and vehicles for you to use as you harness alien technology and turn it against them. </li></ul><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> Persistent Soldiers: Soldiers in Xenonauts are persistent from mission to mission, improving their stats and gaining ranks with combat experience - but their deaths are always only a single bad move away. You will grow to care about the brave men and women under your command as they slowly grow from green rookies into hardened veterans, but that only makes it more painful when their heroic tale is cruelly cut short by a burst of plasma fire...</li></ul><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> Detailed, Emergent Simulation: Xenonauts contains no scripted missions, just broad rules setting the pace of the invasion.

Commence a battle at night and you'll be fighting the mission in the darkness with reduced sight range. If your base is attacked, you fight the defence in a perfect replica of your base.

While <i>Martian Memorandum (1991)</i> continued this tradition of excellent, engaging, and visually stunning gameplay, it wasn't until <i>Under a Killing Moon (1994)</i> that the series really took a leap into the forefront of PC gaming.<br><br><i>Under a Killing Moon</i> not only provided players with rich full-motion video but was also one of the first games to feature a true Hollywood cast. As for the gameplay experience: it was unparalleled. Utilizing Access Software's amazing &quot;Virtual World&quot; engine, the game provided players with completely explorable full-3D environments. Crouch under desks, rifle through drawers, or stand on your toes to glance at the top shelf of a cabinet. Nothing was off-limits, and no other game utilized such immersive technology. Under a Killing Moon would go on to win many awards, including &quot;Best Fantasy Role-Playing/Adventure Program&quot; at the Codie Awards. <br><br><i>The Pandora Directive (1996)</i> continued this tradition of groundbreaking technology by being one of the first FMV adventure titles to feature multiple endings, multiple gameplay paths, and shipped on 6 compact discs. It also featured Hollywood acting talent and won &quot;Best adventure game of 1996&quot; by both Computer Gaming World, and Computer Game Entertainment.<br><br><i>Tex Murphy: Overseer (1998)</i> would come next, and would be the first PC game title to be released on the very new (at the time) DVD format. This enabled the game's full-motion video to be presented at levels of quality never before seen in a video game. While the game was a re-telling of the original <i>Mean Streets</i> story, it also featured Hollywood acting talent, and a completely redesigned 3D Virtual World engine.<br><br>16 years would pass between Overseer's release and Tesla Effect's continuation of the series (thanks to a successfully funded Kickstarter campaign). It would once again maintain Tex Murphy's tradition of ground-breaking adventure game entertainment with 2K full-motion video, full 3D environments, and a dynamic cast of actors to help bring the long-awaited continuation of the Tex Murphy saga to life.<br><br>To learn more about the Tex Murphy series, visit <a href=""https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://bigfinishgames.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""  >http://bigfinishgames.com</a>.","₩ 20,500","['Single-player', 'Steam Trading Cards']",Adventure,515.0

All phases and all the characters are released!<br><br><strong>Hello everyone!<br>Welcome to the craziest adventure of your lives!</strong><br><br>	The Brain Monster from Space decided to become a big successful villain with intergalactic recognition to make his father - a famous monster - proud! For that, he took some gifts he got from his father (giant worms, evil robots and other stuff from alien armies) and started his evil plans: to capture some defenseless damsels, steal some banks, plunder and destroy some planets, he even considers getting into politics!<br>	Brain Monster doesn't care to understand the local wildlife when he invades a planet. So he makes some mistakes, like disguising a drone as a fish or a lobster and sending it to fly saying: - Fly, my little turtle!<br>	One of his evil deeds was to kidnap Babe, Waldisglédson's girlfriend, the pizza boy. Waldisglédson, in turn, joined a special army to find the Brain Monster and rescue his Babe.<br>	The fearless Waldisglédson will face creatures from space and find allies on his journey!<br><br><strong>Mechanics:</strong><br>	The game is a side-scrolling shooter. It contains 01 tutorial stage, 08 main stages with 02 optional stages each, 01 credits stage and 01 stage with different game mechanics, which is subdivided into 09 interdependent parts that form a complex puzzle. In total, there are 27 stages.<br>	The player has at their disposal 04 different weapons for 16 characters (01 starting weapon, 03 unlockables and 12 very well-hidden), each with a unique special ability. There are also collectible items hidden throughout the stages and 100 medals obtained with player skills. The instructions to get the medals are in a screen accessed through the stage select screen.<br>	The controls are as simple as can be. The options are chosen with the mouse and the ENTER key. The player uses the arrow keys to move the character and the space key to attack. The ENTER key, when pressed during a stage, aborts the mission and returns to the stage select screen.<br>	If the player wants to find every one of the 16 characters, he must pay attention to the description of the 04 main characters. Every main character, when selected, shows a small text saying in what stage his 03 friends are. A main character cannot find the friends of the other main characters. Each one of these friends will ask for two gifts in exchange for their help, and they will tell where the gifts are. When the player has the two gifts, he must return to the stage where the friend was and deliver them. The gifts can only be found if the user has already found the friend who asks for them. After finding both gifts for a friend, the player can use any character to deliver them. Doing this, the player adds a new character to his host.<br>	The subtitles are available in Portuguese, Spanish and English, and can be changed at the beginning of the game.<br>	After choosing the subtitles, the player can do a small trick: when the 4 main characters and the start menu show up on the screen, they can hold the space key until a light flashes on the screen. The player can then click on &quot;new game&quot;. This way, the player starts with full power, lives, ammo and armor, every stage and character unlocked and a huge part of the medals.","₩ 1,100","['Single-player', 'Steam Achievements', 'Steam Trading Cards']",Action,116.0

2616,Carcassonne - Tiles & Tactics,"New version of the muti-awarded game. Now in 3D. Includes improved IA, 3D landscape, new exclusive features.                                                                              <br />
<br />
*** Carcassonne fits that opening game niche that every game group needs. -Tyler Nichols, Board Game Quest<br />
*** Carcassonne = Great game, great mechanics, great pieces, great fun! -The Board Game Family<br />
*** Carcassonne's recent Android re-release and its fresh, new features are a joy to experience*** Pocket Gamer<br />
<br />
A TILE PLACEMENT GAME OF CREATING LANDSCAPES, CLAIMING AREAS, AND GAINING POINTS<br />
<br />
Carcassonne is a modern classic tile-placement game based on the award wining game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, et cetera. The player can then decide to place one of his followers, so called Meeples, on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner. Each new game is a new experience thanks to the ever-changing landscape.<br />
<br />
ENJOY FUN AND TACTICAL GAMEPLAY<br />
<br />
During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, making it harder for him to complete his goal and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.<br />
<br />
2 EXPANSIONS : ENLARGE YOUR LANDSCAPE AND OPTIMIZE YOUR POINTS<br />
<br />
Thanks to the mini expansions &quot;The River&quot; and &quot;The Abbot&quot;, you can embellish your landscape and vary your game to enjoy new ways to play!<br />

• 2 expansions: The River and The Abbot<br />
